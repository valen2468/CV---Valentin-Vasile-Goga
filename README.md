CV Made using HTML and CSS.

First of all, this is the Figma design for the CV:

Second, in order to use some icons I used (I don't know if it's a framework or not) font awesome, link: https://cdnjs.com/libraries/font-awesome and
https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.2.1/css/fontawesome.min.css

Adding: 
link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.2.1/css/fontawesome.min.css" integrity="sha512-giQeaPns4lQTBMRpOOHsYnGw1tGVzbAIHUyHRgn7+6FmiEgGGjaG0T2LZJmAPMzRCl+Cug0ItQ2xDZpTmEc+CQ==" crossorigin="anonymous" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"

made it possible to use their icons for some parts of the CV. I thought about using it because they had some icons that went very well with the format and the layout of the CV in general.


Project analysis:
- Final user: the user in this case will be companies/game studios/employers who wants to see what skills do I have and my education and work experience over these years, in order to do so, I made this CV in HTML and CSS to partly demonstrate my skills and experience expecting to catch someons attention, preferably, game studios. In general, the final user will be anyone who wants to know my CV, what work experience I have, skills, etc...

- Information Architecture: the information architecture it's quite simple because we are replicating a CV but in HTML and CSS, this CV will have colors, shadows, gradients, etc... The content of the CV is usually a photo of yourself, your name, languages you know, skills, interests, actitude and profile at work, education and work experience.

- Visual Design: the color palette in the CV alternates between green and blue using linear gradients to ensure a smooth transition from a color to the other. For the letters and the typography we use system-ui. The layout is a single page with information about the person from the CV in the left and information about education and experience in the right.
